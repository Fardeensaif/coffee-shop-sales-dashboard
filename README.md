Project Title: Coffee Shop Sales Analysis â˜•ðŸ“Š

I'm excited to share my recent data analysis project, where I worked on analyzing retail sales data for a local coffee shop chain. The main objective was to uncover actionable insights to enhance the performance and operations of the coffee shop. Through this project, I focused on key questions that could drive strategic decisions for improving sales, inventory, and customer satisfaction.
Key Analysis Highlights:

â˜• How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?                
Sales peak during weekdays, especially in the morning (8-11 AM), as people grab their coffee on the way to work.

â˜• Are there any peak times for sales activity?     

Peak sales activity occurs on Fridays between 8 AM and 10 AM, and there's also a noticeable uptick on weekends between 10 AM and 1 PM.

â˜• What is the total sales revenue for each month?

The highest sales revenue was recorded in june and total sales of 149116 , largely due to the holiday season, with promotions boosting sales.

â˜• How do sales vary across different store locations?

Urban store locations generate higher sales compared to suburban ones, especially during weekdays. Suburban stores perform better on weekends.

â˜• What is the average price/order per person?

The average order price per person is $7.80, with customers generally purchasing 1-2 items per visit.

â˜• Which products are the best-selling in terms of quantity and revenue?

Lattes and cappuccinos are the best-selling products by quantity, while premium beverages like frappes and specialty teas generate the most revenue.

â˜• How do sales vary by product category and type?

Beverages make up 65% of total sales, with coffee-based drinks dominating the product mix. Pastries and snacks contribute to 35% of total revenue but perform better during afternoon hours.
This project allowed me to apply data analysis techniques to uncover key trends and recommendations for optimizing the coffee shop's operations.
Excited to dive deeper into more data-driven insights!
